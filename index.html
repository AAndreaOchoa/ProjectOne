        <h2>About Me </h2>

        <p>I was born in San Francisco and raised in Oakland, where my passion for art was sparked at an early age.
            Inspired by the creativity of my artsy friends and my older sister's love for Project Runway, I started
            sketching in the fifth grade and haven't stopped since. I specialized in color pencil and would make realistic
            portraits for most of my life, but I could not see myself pursuing a future in studio art.</p>
            <p>Senior year of high school, I got a marketing/customer service tech internship at a datacloud company, and
                it shifted my perspective of what I wanted to do with my future. In my internship, I began using Adobe Cloud
                software like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. This type of exposure made me gain an interest in graphic
                design. My past experiences have made me a detail-oriented person and also showed me that people value my input
                for how something should be displayed visually. </p>
                <p>Now in my second year here at San Francisco State University, I am majoring in Visual Communication Design
                    and I'm eager to explore the different parts that make up this field. I'm excited to continue to expand my
                    creative skills and discover the areas that inspire me the most in the years to come.</p>

        <h2>these are a few artists who inspire me</h2>
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X">Bad Bunny</a>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Bunny.png" alt="Bad Bunny's new Spotify profile picture of his face with a neon green background.">
        <h4>I find Bad Bunny very inspiring because he is prideful about his culture and uses his platform to shed light to the
            injustices that his Puerto Rican community faces.</h4>

        <a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/takashi-murakami/">Takashi Murakami</a>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Murakami.png" alt="Takashi Murakami smiling while wearing a bright rainbow flower hat.">
        <h4>Takashi's art style is very playful and colorful which is what I find most intriguing. Being able to be recognizable
            globally and established in the art, music and fashion industries are huge accomplishments.</h4>

        <a href="https://www.sabrinacarpenter.com/">Sabrina Carpenter</a>
        <br>

        <h4>What I find most inspiring is when artist create a little theme surrounding each album. In Sabrina's new album she
            uses pastels as her color palette and uses her song "Espresso" to collaborate with big brands.</h4>
